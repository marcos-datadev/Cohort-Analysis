# Cohort-Analysis
On this repo, i'll upload an study created by me from the scratch on client retention. For so, I've chosse the Cohort Analysis since that is a major metric when we are trying to understrand the client pattern of acess.

The month of december seems to be roked, so it's not on the analysis.
